## Setup
All code in this repo is written in Python 3, and assumes that you have the [SciPy ecosystem](https://www.scipy.org/) setup on your machine along with either [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) or [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/). If you don't, then you might want to consider setting everything up in an environment with [Conda](https://conda.io/docs/).

Remember to initialize the book's submodule with
```bash
git submodule update --init
```
