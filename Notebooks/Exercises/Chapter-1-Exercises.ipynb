We won't need the actual input value, we just need the input to have been fixed. Suppose the weights and biases are such that $\\vec{w} \\cdot \\vec{x} + b \\neq 0$ for the input $x$ to any particular perceptron in the network. Now replace all the perceptrons in the network by sigmoid neurons, and multiply the weights and biases by a positive constant $c > 0$. Show that in the limit as $c\\to \\infty$ the behaviour of this network of sigmoid neurons is exactly the same as the network of perceptrons. How can this fail when $\\vec{w} \\cdot \\vec{x} + b = 0$ for one of the perceptrons?"

The extra layer converts the output from the previous layer into a binary representation, as illustrated in the figure below. Find a set of weights and biases for the new output layer. Assume that the first 3 layers of neurons are such that the correct output in the third layer (i.e., the old output layer) has activation at least 0.99, and incorrect outputs have activation less than 0.01."
